# pi-home-dashboard

This is a simple Node.js backend and Vue frontend written to pull in data from two HTTP endpoints that are fed by my AM2302 temperature/humidity sensors, as well as the current power consumption, production, and charge percentage and state of a Tesla Powerwall 2 battery, and display it on a screen in a dashboard fashion.
